# MyCLI

This is a pivot from learning Rust to learning Swift. I'm doing the [initial myCLI tutorial](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/cli-swiftpm/), to understand the development environment. 

Setting up the project:
```
$ mkdir MyCLI
$ cd MyCLI
$ swift package init --name MyCLI --type executable
```
